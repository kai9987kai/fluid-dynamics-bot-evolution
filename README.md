# fluid-dynamics-bot-evolution
This repository contains an implementation of a fluid dynamics bot that uses neural networks and a genetic algorithm to evolve its shape and navigate through obstacles. The bot's shape is dynamically adjusted based on simulated fluid forces, and a neural network determines its movement. The genetic algorithm drives the evolution of the bot's shape by selecting the fittest individuals from each generation. The simulation runs for multiple generations, continuously improving the bot's ability to navigate obstacles. The code is written in Python and utilizes the turtle graphics library for visualization.
