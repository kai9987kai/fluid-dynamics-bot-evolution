# fluid-dynamics-bot-evolution
This repository contains an implementation of a fluid dynamics bot that uses neural networks and a genetic algorithm to evolve its shape and navigate through obstacles. The bot's shape is dynamically adjusted based on simulated fluid forces, and a neural network determines its movement. The genetic algorithm drives the evolution of the bot's shape by selecting the fittest individuals from each generation. The simulation runs for multiple generations, continuously improving the bot's ability to navigate obstacles. The code is written in Python and utilizes the turtle graphics library for visualization.



By observing the results, we can see the following:

The initial generations start with random shapes, and the fitness of the bots' shapes varies.
As the generations progress, we notice some shapes that consistently perform better and are selected as the fittest individuals.
The fittest bot's shape tends to undergo modifications to improve its ability to navigate obstacles.
The shapes become more refined and optimized over time, with some generations producing shapes that perform significantly better than previous ones.
In some cases, the fittest bot's shape may reach a plateau, where further generations do not lead to significant improvements.

Overall, the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the genetic algorithm and neural networks in evolving and adapting the bot's shape to successfully navigate through obstacles in the fluid dynamics simulation.
